Please follow the following instructions:

1) Make sure sql is installed on your local. When you configure sql, make sure you create a user called "root" that has no password.
2) Install the SQL adapter for python by using "easy_install MySQL-python"
3) SQL in as the root user and create a table called "ring"
4) Call "python manage.py syncdb"
5) Start a mysql session and use the ring database, and call "show tables." Make sure the api_* tables are present.

Anytime you want to create a new application, call "python manage.py startapp <appname>" and make sure you go into Ring/settings.py to modify the INSTALLED-APPS function by adding your app at the bottom.

Let me know if you guys have any questions.
